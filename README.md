# gaming-store-program

The project I have worked on is creating an online gaming shop called “GAMING LEGENDS” 
where they provide gaming products to the customers through an online shop.
This application will positively affect businesses as they will still be able to run 24/7. The program contains an 
interactive menu for customers to view, add items to cart and purchase items from the menus
of different gaming products they desire and addition to that it contains features for staff of the 
company where they can login with the credentials to view information about the store such as 
the customers who have purchased with them, and to view the products sold and more.
